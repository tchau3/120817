Commonly defined as pleasure derived from suffering, masochism has in fact undergone several rounds of revision in Freud’s early studies. Emerging from a perverse, gender-specific notion, it will later acquire a broader significance in relation to the death drive and other basic instincts in Freud’s later writings. This essay will trace the desexualization and depathologization of masochism in three texts, The Wolf Man (1918), A Child in Being Beaten (1920), and Beyond the Pleasure Principle (1920). A clinical manifestation of this kind is first called by its name in The Wolf Man, where it is treated as a form of sexual perversion: the boy fantasizes about copulating with or being beaten on the genitals by the father, through which he learns to desire the passive role and experiences pain as pleasure. The first part of my essay will situate the birth of masochism in this text. I will argue that, framed in terms of femininity and the fear of castration, masochism is ultimately a product of the analyst’s misogynist lens on pleasure and sexuality. Being a woman is, at this stage of analysis, synonymous with being passive and pain-loving. This construct is mirrored in the male masochist as the reasoning, I don’t want to be castrated, so I will punish any act that makes me passive or womanly, even if it means inflicting pain on myself.

I will then problematize this phallic notion of masochism and try to show that, because it fails to establish a point-to-point linkage between pleasure and pain, it is not true masochism. If the subject is going through all that pain to preserve his masculinity as a matter of principle – I would rather be in pain than be a woman – then the pleasure lies not in the pain itself but in knowing that one has done the right thing (avoided castration). The pleasure is moral; it is in appeasing guilt felt towards almost losing the male part. In A Child in Being Beaten, Freud tries to rectify this disjunction and searches for ways to satisfy the equation pleasure = pain. It is discovered here that this equation is only possible in the language of the unconscious. Through repression, things can be converted to their opposites, and pleasure can become pain.

Lastly, I will invoke a third text, Beyond the Pleasure Principle (1920), in showing how the death drive, namely, the desire to attain a state of zero stimuli, can be seen as an extension of the same masochist instinct. At this final stage, the latter is desexualized and depathologized. Aggression – self-aggression especially – is held as a vital force at the most basic level of being for male and female alike. The fantastical resolution of opposites in the paradox of masochism is carried back to the point of origin, such that life itself becomes a function of pleasure = pain.

I. The Phallic Martyr

From the outset, masochism is associated with the female sex in a way that is perhaps more telling of the analyst’s bias than the nature of the so-called neurosis. Even before the Wolf Man, in his treatment of Dora (1901), Freud was unwavering in his belief that the patient’s dream conceals her yearning for “a man seeking to force an entrance into the female genitalia .” When presented with a detail from the dream, I then saw a thick wood before me which I went into, he chose, of all things, to relate the woods to pubic hair, “nymphae” (the jargon for labia minora), and nymphs (traditionally assumed to be salacious and seductive) . Even after Dora repeatedly voiced her annoyance at her suitor, Herr K., Freud still believed that Dora secretly longed for him and that her feeling of disgust was merely repressed sexual excitations . The most unsettling aspect of this conclusion is not that it is right or wrong but the insidious male gaze and male voice that permeate it. It is as if the analyst’s pair of eyes is on Dora’s back as she beheld the Sistine Madonna , and we have the theatricals of a man looking at a virgin looking at the Virgin. It is in this triad that we find the birth of masochism: it does not originate in the body of Dora but is a floating vision – double vision – of the analyst who sees Dora as the v/Virgin. In one word, masochism started as a product of countertransference, of the analyst thinking his patient is who he wants her to be, i.e. a virgin. It is the male lens that “discovered” masochism, and for that reason it is always the female, the nymph, Dora, who desires transgression.

Freud’s attempt to pass masochism as a result of having a vagina is stopped short by the case of a young boy exhibiting the same perversion. Now he must provide an explanation for why a male subject would feel the same desire for pain, especially when it is inflicted on him by the father. The change in the sex of the patient alerted Freud to the role of the male genital, i.e. the phallus or the lack thereof, in the articulation of masochism. More precisely, he argues that what makes the boy content with being passive is his oblivion of the link between passivity and castration/femininity.

According to the timeline of the neurosis, events with masochist leaning – phantasies of being beaten on the penis, attempts to “seduce” punishment from the father – happened between the age of three and four. At this time, the boy is still in the pre-genital stage, which means his notion of pleasure is shaped not around his penis. The emphasis is placed on being touched/beaten, not on the genital; it is the action not the object that excites him.

Once he makes the link between being a woman and being passive, he flees, abhorred, from this means of attaining pleasure. It was all revealed to him in the primal scene (Urszenen), or rather, his interpretation of it three years later. The term refers to the child’s sighting of coitus between his parents at the age of one-and-a-half years , in which sex was performed a tergo (from behind) three times. All he could tell at that time was that it was a violent act and that, as he read from the mother’s expression, it was enjoyable. It was not until later, when he has amassed all the “tools” – constant red flags of castration in fairy tales, the sight of girls urinating, Nanya’s threat that masturbation leaves a “wound”, and the chopping off of wolf tails and snake bodies  – that he made the connection. “Active was the same as masculine, while passive was the same as feminine .” In the primal scene, the analyst is no longer the one looking; it is the child, free of dust (or rather the image of the nymph or Madonna) in his eyes, who sees his mother. Consequently, his lens is more phallic than paternal, which is the lens of the analyst. He interprets the scene purely in the sense of genitals. He now sees that the female occupies a position of lack, bearing a ‘wound’ where the penis should be, so that she can be given pleasure by the father. In fact, losing his penis is the only way for him to be loved by his object choice, the father. He ran from the deal. The fear of castration, then, turned the boy away from masochist perversion. At the age of four, he so to say “repented” and got back in line with the whole “what a man should be like” (active, in control) and “whom he should be attracted to” (women).

Note that here masochism is confined to an earlier stage of development, the pre-genital phase. Freud looked at the timeline and saw a contiguity and contemporaneity between sadistic abuse and masochistic fantasies. Noting that the boy started obsessing with being chastised and beaten right around the time when he liked to throw fits of rage and torment small animals, Freud reasons that masochism occurs in the analsadistic phase. As a result, masochist pleasure is tattered to a sadist one, and the two are seen as offshoots of the same instinct: aggression. Then, due to some repressive force, the spearheads are turned from what is out there, the object, to what is in here, the ego, turning sadism inward. So far, the stimulation he gets is not yet explicitly sexual, but egocentric. Freud even speculated on guilt being part of this turn inward, vaguely hinting that it is related to masturbation  but is stirred up by something from the non-sexual sphere . 
But guilt presupposes moral violated. What is this moral according to Freud? We know that earlier the boy had played with his penis in front of Nanya in order to seduce her, but the attempt was thwarted and he was warned that children who masturbate “got a ‘wound’ in that place .” Here the act of seduction is cut short by the fear of castration. In the beating phantasies, too, while the boy longs to be copulated by his father, he is also scared of losing his penis. Guilt, then, is felt towards the genitals - I am so sorry that I almost lost it by playing with it; it is to steer the boy away from androgyny. At this premier stage of analysis then, the masochist answers to the Phallus, and is submissive only to it, in that he would rather be whipped than be a woman. The kind of pleasure derived from it is one of allaying guilt and appeasing the ego.

II. The True Masochist

Freud’s formulation of masochism in The Wolf Man immediately raises a conundrum: how does one explain the explicit focus on genitals in the boy’s fantasies of being beaten on the penis, if developmentally he is not “there” yet? The only way this would work is if pleasure and unpleasure is no longer point-to-point, in a starve-the-penis-feed-the-ego type of way. But doesn’t this defeat the premise of masochism being the derivation of pleasure exactly where it hurts? In other words, to preserve the essence of masochism, satisfaction obtained from masochism has to remain sexual. For this reason, the masochist subject must not be stuck in a pre-phallic/pre-genital phase, since a share of the pleasure by definition has to fall on the genital itself. Freud must think of a way in which keeping the penis, i.e. opting to not become a woman, does not immunize one against masochism, and in which being a woman alone does not guarantee a fetish for pain. For boys and girls alike, it is also the “turning around” of the pain on the genital as pleasure that comprises the essence of masochism. This will be the next big problem Freud tries to solve in a study two years later, A Child is Being Beaten.

In this study, Freud notices a common infantile phantasy – “a child is being beaten” – among his patients that yields a high degree of pleasure in the genitals. He divides the phantasy into three phases for the girl, and two for the boy. In the first phase for the girl, the adult (almost invariably the father) is beating another child; in the second, it is girl herself who is beaten by the father; in the third, the identity of both the adult and the child changes – though the ones being beaten are always boys – e.g. a teacher punishing a group of schoolboys . For the boy, the first stage is missing and the phantasy starts at the second phase with the boy himself being beaten by the mother, which then morphs into a third phase where the identity of the beater is masked while he himself remains the victim .

Our first instinct is to pair the Wolf Man’s beating phantasies with phase II in boys. But we at once notice the caveat in this model: it does not account for a sadist precursor  which is present in the Wolf Man case, nor does the Wolf Man ever identify the sex of the beater in his fantasies – if anything, he has only ever tries to provoke punishment from his father. A more striking parallel runs, instead, between Wolf Man’s neurosis and the three phases in girls. This is not surprising as the patient is known to have displayed feminine attitude toward both sexes. If we match the Wolf Man’s beating fantasies with phase II (“my father is beating me”), then what comes before that, the sadistic abuse of Nanya and animals must map onto the proto-sadistic phase I, which Banquo deems and Freud quotes, “not clearly sexual, not in itself sadistic, but yet the stuff from which both will later come .” Not quite at the genital phase, these manifestations please only the ego by allaying jealousy or hurt from rejection. The same parallel can be drawn for what comes after the Wolf Man’s beating phantasies, i.e. the initiation into the genital phase. Just as by dreaming the dream at four years old, the Wolf Man “solved” the genital implication of the primal scene, so does the girl experience a eureka! of “strong and unambiguous sexual excitement ” in phase III of the beating sequence. This leaves the intermediate phase, which Freud associates most closely with masochism.

All children, according to Freud, as part of their infantile sexuality, fall in love with the father. The child wants the father to itself, and so grows hostile to rivals of any kind (e.g. siblings). But when this love is continually frustrated, the child’s hatred toward others is turned back against itself. The phantasy of this new phase is therefore a total reversal of the one before it; instead of the narcissistic “my father loves only me, and not the other child, for he is beating it ;” it now reads, “no, he does not love you, for he is beating you .” This shift from hetero- to auto-aggression, from object to ego, from others to self, is shared by Wolf Man and A Child. Like the former, A Child foregrounds guilt as the driving force of this shift.

It talks, however, of a different kind of guilt. Recall that, in the Wolf Man, guilt is directed at masturbation; Nanya’s warning of a “wound” is a repudiation of the penis as an acceptable site for erotism. In this new study, Freud notices that it is not just the act itself that haunts the child but also the person whom this act invokes, i.e. the father. When the child realizes it can never be with the father, it also regrets its incestuous object choice . The child does not want to deal with his father any more than he wants to deal with his genitals, and the way to achieve those is by two processes: regression and repression . Regression, as we have seen before, sets back the child’s sexual development a few years so that he can finds pleasure some place other than the genitals. Repression, on the other hand, provides a solution in situ by blocking the undesired fact, desire, thought (e.g. incest) from consciousness. Though related, the two differ greatly in their mechanisms. Regression is playback, time-traveling, taking steps back. Repression, by contrast, is the masking, pushing-under of something one cannot live with. As such, a child in regression may have a total change of heart and not want what it used to want, but a child who represses its desire still wants the same thing, except now it is oblivious of such yearning.

The entire phantasy of “my father is beating me” is erected on these grounds. It is, as Freud explains, the incestuous wish repressed. Since the child cannot, in broad daylight, pursue its desire of “being loved by the father,” it takes a detour. It substitutes “being loved” with “being beaten” so that this taboo wish will go uncensored by him in his right mind. Therefore, it is not that the child does not want his father anymore, but that the incestuous wish has become unconscious , and came back as a different thing. Sometimes the work of distortion can even make it so that opposites equate.

It is in the most forgiving language of the unconscious, then, that we find the equation pleasure = pain viable. “This being beaten is now a meeting place between the sense of guilt and sexual love. It is not only the punishement for the forbidden genital relation, but also the regressive substitute for it .” The libidinal excitement associated with “love” is now injected into “beating” so that to the unconscious the two are one and the same. Thus, returning to the problem of deriving pleasure exactly where there is unpleasure, can we not say that, on the level of the unconscious, pain is but pleasure by other means, disguised and displaced?

What has become increasing clear to Freud in A Child is Being Beaten is that the unconscious has its own way of perceiving pleasure so that life remains livable. The five or six year old who is “cheated out” of the oedipal complex, of incestuous love permissible in a world without male-female distinctions, must deal with vestiges of these early times in a way that allows him/her to develop normally. S/he chooses to bury them deep, give them a different façade, even if it means this façade is pain. For the unconscious, it just has to be pleasurable enough to sustain life.

III. Death Drive as Masochism

Already one sees emerging from A Child a link between trauma and sexuality. To enter into genital-organization, thus take on the rôle of a phallus or a vagina, the child must be shocked out of an earlier, undifferentiated state. When the Wolf Man woke up from the primal scene screaming, having now fully grasped the reality of castration and, by extension, the two sexes, he showed us that sexuality is traumatic in nature. At this point we can imagine the child, who now knows the right way forward, being unable to leave behind that world of androgyny. We can safely say that masochism, by disguising illicit pleasure as pain, is his way of returning to a time past.

The enigmatic Beyond the Pleasure Principle is born out of such strain of thinking. Having lost his daughter Sophie to the Spanish Flu and treated many shell-shocked soldiers, Freud, working off of an anti-vitalist mindset, wrestles with a psychical explanation for the omnipresence of death. How very apt that he centered his discussion on pleasure! Pleasure, in this context refers to a reduction in stimuli while unpleasure refers to a rush of excitation . Then, based on these, he proposes the death drive. The pleasure principle taken to extreme, the death drive denotes a tendency in all living beings to revert to the inorganic state , i.e. to obtain a ground energy level of zero, which is deemed most pleasurable. Immediately we see the nod to masochism: like the latter, the death drive is a fantastical union of two opposing agenda; the quest to allay and stifle life itself is the same as (or must go through) that which excites and causes unpleasure. In so doing, Freud has driven the principles of masochism into the dawn of life and made sexuality part of our originary imagination. The model is now, as illustrated by Laplanche :

<img>

and the implications are as follows:
1. Masochism is emancipated from a derivative of sadism to one of the earliest instincts on earth. And, as all instincts go, masochism is an attempt to return to an earlier state  – a quality we already witnessed in the case of the post-oedipal child trying to return to androgyny. In fact, this “early state” to which the death drive is drawn, is, for sexuality, Plato’s androgyne  and for survival, the womb. Why the womb? Because it is where the infant, completely passive and dependent on another for excitation, learns to enjoy unpleasure/stimulation . As Laplanche points out in Why the Death Drive, the death drive purports the priority of self- or selbst- phase, in which the organism is totally closed in upon itself, over an open, relational phase . In this primordial state, aggression already exists; that is, at the level of survival, aggression is already in place and is dealt at the ego itself . In order for the organism to live (to have energy > 0) at all, it must wreak, rip, break – or be wreaked, ripped, broken – and be able to derive some form of pleasure from the rush of excitation. This is what Freud terms “primary masochism,” the existence of which he denied in the two former studies . The sadism → masochism construct is now reversed, and masochism is made the earliest and most basic form of aggression .

2. Survival and sexuality now share the language of pleasure, hence masochism. Conveniently, life and sexuality are both framed as traumas: the high-energy we gain from being half of the androgyne (the whole, bisexual humanoid being the lowest energy state) is comparable to the blasts, glares, and stings we wake to, from inside the womb. And masochism is the “turning around” of these pains as pleasure. In both cases, masochism is now the birth pain, the mediator of opposites that makes life possible.

3. The organism is first autoerotic, then seeks pleasure in others, for the same reason that it is first auto- then hetero- aggressive. It “creates” its own drive by taking in the rush of excitation and “satisfies” it by turning it around as pleasure, not needing the phallus or the lack thereof. Hetero-erotism only came into being on the basis of sexual utility: it is there as a means to “overpower the sexual object to the extent necessary for carrying out the sexual act .” As one can imagine, this path that follows from the ego to the object contrasts starkly with that from the object to the ego. The object → ego route is corrective; it operates by guilt and repression. Specifically, it implies the ego’s role as a censor and restrictor of sexual instincts (e.g. incestuous love for the father). By contrast, the ego → object pathway is inclusive. It breaks down the opposition between the ego and the genitals and shows the libido that flows from one to the other as one and the same . Overall this serves to depathologize masochism. Once viewed as the threat of incest on the ego and masculinity, it now serves as the structuring action of how all life came to being.

4. The line between pleasure and unpleasure is blurred and new definitions are at hand. Both are objectified, or rather, economized, with the emphasis not on how it feels but what what it looks like in energy terms. Pain (Unlust), as Laplanche points out, is now broadly defined as “effraction of the boundary and a rush of ‘unbound’ energy .” Pleasure is split into two: pleasure of the drive, which is “frenetic” in energy, and pleasure of satisfaction, which is stable or low in energy . Evidently, the part of pleasure with “frenetic” energy coincides with pain, and pain, in its own rush of energy produces pleasure. Let us apply this to the case of the beating phantasy, in which pleasure is attained from pain on the genitals. By our new definition, pleasure comes not only from the allaying of guilt but also the “libidinous excitement” which beating inherited from sexual love, the thing it replaces . This love, coming from a place of not having but wanting to have, falls under the high-energy pleasure of the drive. What this means is that there can be an enjoyment in rising tension as well as its release, as pleasure encompasses both the desire/want/lust and its satisfaction . 

All three texts have tried to solve the paradox posed by masochism, i.e. pleasure = pain. In The Wolf Man, we see an alignment of masochism with femininity and pleasure obtained not in a genital but moral sense. Thought as sadism turned inward, masochism as a general attack on the self and the ego produces pleasure through atonement, the allaying of guilt. This guilt is none other than that felt toward the phallus and being so close to losing it and forfeiting the precious masculinity. In A Child is being Beaten masochism is localized to the genitals and a point-to-point mapping of pleasure and pain is attempted. It is found that pleasure = pain only works in the realm of the unconscious, since the latter often disguises things as their opposites to make them acceptable to the rational, and one should add heterosexual, mind. The incestuous sexual desire for the father is repressed in this way and “loving” is disguised as “beating.” Finally, in Beyond the Pleasure Principle, the paradox is taken up in economic terms. We find that “pain” as a rush of energy is in fact a part of pleasure, called “pleasure of the drive.” The ability to withstand a rise in stimuli and enjoy it, in one word, the masochist instinct, is carried back to the origin and hailed as a necessary condition for life.
