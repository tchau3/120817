<!--excerpt.start-->
In a recreated cloister from 12th century France, at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, a Romanesque capital shows grotesque scenes of demons punishing Avarice and Blasphemy (Fig. 1). This bell-shaped component, measuring 11-1/2 inches in height and 8 inches in length and width, crowns an unfluted, slender column that raises the work to eye level. Little is known about the artist except that he made the work around 1175-1200 in Southern France. Made to be viewed in the round, the capital is covered with stone relief on all four sides: the two major scenes showing punitive rituals are placed back to back, while the sides in between, crawling with serpents/dragons that sprout from the demons’ torsos, serve both as a continuation of the narrative and a completion to the all-round design. In one scene, the capital shows a personification of Blasphemy having his tongue pulled by a tong and his hand bitten by a snake. On the opposite side, an emaciated Avarice, weighed down by a bag of gold around his shoulders, descends into the mouth of a monster. His arms are clutched by two demons (one of the which has been effaced) and his legs by a pair of claws. In both scenes, theatricality overtakes naturalism as the naked, boneless limbs of the sinners contort into impossible angles – one of the blasphemer’s kicking legs even bends around the corner into the next frame. Moral message is carried through expressiveness: the grooves in the demons’ draperies and wings, and the tactile quality of his scales do not make credible the figures but serve merely as a symbol for evil forces and a means to exact fear from the viewer. The sinner’s bulging eyes and clutching hands not only convey but also transfuse his state of excruciating pain. The head and hand of the characters are exaggerated so that as monks stroll pass the capital, they can feel the action jut out of its plane into the viewer’s space. The message of admonition is made most explicit when the demons stare maliciously out at their next victim in real life.

The power dynamic between the demon and the sins is so stark that it is easy to miss a subtle kinship between the two types of evil, that is, the corrupted morality of the sinner and the inherent monstrosity of the punisher. The coming together of the two in this particular manner, in an autophagy of evil forces, begs further investigations into the nature of their union and its place in the medieval consicence. In the first part of this paper, I will show the visual aspects of the union, bringing in relevant works in geographic and temporal proximity as well as historical precedents, with the hope of establishing the PMA capital as part of a wider praxis to spread punitive imagery. The second part will try to account for why this trope grew in number. Combining theories in psychology, history, science, and behavioral studies, this section illustrates how changes in visual schemes can result from a summation of societal factors. Finally, I will revisit the PMA capital with analytical tools borrowed from the second part, and contextualize it within the 12th century French monastic setting.

I.

Despite their seamless merging in this work, the demon and the sinner had evolved from two separate strands of iconographic traditions. The bestial quality of the demons is rooted in classical depiction of pagan gods. From the satyr Pan, medieval artists derive the cloven feet, tail, and pointed ears, from Medusa the grimace, and from Charun the hooked nose, wings, and teeth . The humanness of the sinner, on the other hand, harkens back to the practice of moral representation, which is the same lineage that gave rise to Virtues. Adolf Katzenellenbogen discerns two currents for the depiction of sinners: one being the representation of battles between Vices and Virtue dating back to the 5th century; the other being a static scheme of sinner types, also based on classical models, that treats each quality separately . The PMA sinners could have come from either mode. Moreover, the identifiers for avarice (the moneybag) and blasphemy (the tongue) most likely stem from the same source, Prudentius’ <em>Psychomachia</em>.

Despite their different provenance, there seem to be some familiarity between the demon and the sinner that warrants occasional mergence. Attributes of the sin and the sinner are sometimes conflated, a union which then changes the nature of their relationships. Zoomorphic features, for instance, is one such attribute that gets attached or detached based on the conception of evil. Sirens, a symbol of volumpitas and luxuria, often appear as an attractive female with a fishtail  (Fig. 2). This differs from an earlier type of interaction, where wantons have their breasts and abdomen sucked out by toads and snakes . Though both condemn the woman, the sin is different in each case. The siren is sinful because of her fishtail, that is, her bestiality, while the wanton is sinful as human; she is tempted, not the temptation itself. The latter, as Prudentius would say “lends the vices the character rather of mortal sinners than of inescapable demons ,” and implies a moral agency for the perpetrator. Similarly, the miser is often depicted with demons, because apparently the moneybag alone is too ambiguous to show that avarice is a sin at all . The union between iconographies of demons and sins is therefore catalyzed by a conceptual shift which made the sinner more human and the sin less so. And despite the large number of such depictions today, Psychostasis is not initially a common subject for visual representation in the Latin West – the first of which occurred in 11th century Amien in a manuscript  – let alone the inclusion of demons, which does not surface until early 12th century. These demon-sinner duos on the tympana of cathedrals in southern France, typically in a Last Judgment scene, is what prefigure the trope we see today on the PMA capital.

Around the same time, the duo also trickles into local practices. Priscilla Baumann’s study of capitals at eight different Romanesque churches in Auvergne, south-central France offers ample analogies to the object of interest. At Maringues, Sait-Myon, Orcival and Chanteuges, she found numerous examples of avarice being depicted as wearing a moneybag around his neck, naked (except for the one at Chanteuges) and assaulted by a pair of demonic creatures. Even when the punishers are evidently human, as in case with Ennezat (Fig. 3), the voice of the devil echoes in an inscription that reads CANDO USURAM ACCEPISTI OPERA MEA FECISTI (“since you have practiced usury, you have done my work”) . A striking parallel between these and the avarice scene on PMA’s capital, particularly in the frontality and rigidity of the sinner’s pose and the symmetry in composition, sheds light on the latter’s origin. If, like Baumann suggests, such motif is indeed “within the confines of Auvergne ,” then the PMA capital may well have abutted the Clermont-Brioude route. The only glitch in this theory is that it does not account for the monstrous mouth in the scene, nor does it explain the image of blasphemy on the other side. Instead, both of these elements are found in the tympanum of Ste. Foy, Conques – this is a comparison that Baumann refrains from making because it will contradict her point about a localized concern over avarice and usury. In our case, however, it would be hard to ignore the dialogues exchanged between the giant wolf head emerging from the Hell Gate who is in the process of devouring a sinner (Fig. 4) and its counterpart on the PMA capital. So much alike are the treatments of mane, eyes, snout, and claws that their connection should not be dismissed. Torture of the sin of the tongue is represented twice: once with the ballad singer and once with the blasphemer. Not to mention the same fibered muscles in the demons, the gnarling of limbs, and the articulation of strain and tension caused by physical contact. Bridging the local and the regional, the PMA capital shows how the visual trope of demons punishing the sins and the type of relationship it establishes between actions and consequences, between human desires and demonic forces, was in fact a widespread phenomenon. The next section will focus on the sociohistorical factors surrounding this proliferation.

II.

Scholarly texts on this subject tend to attribute the sudden multiplication of such imagery to two interrelated factors. The first is external, and has to do with a desire to tighten societal control, an initiative taken towards ecclesiastical reform, or a legislative act passed to institutionalize individual conscience. Scholars who advocate this view often see the trope’s presence tympana, capitals, and door jambs as an effort to accompany some systematic renovation. This view is supplemented by a second, internal factor concerning a personal and persistent need for soul-cleansing.

Writing about the practice of penance, Mary F. Braswell hints at the impact of Pope Innocent III’s Fourth Lateran Council (1215) on pictorial programs. The 21st Canon, she asserts, which made annual penance a duty is reinforced by portrayals in sacred spaces . Echoing her point, Kevin W. McManamy in probing the context for demonic capitals at Vézelay associates their sudden onset with a monastic reform at Cluny. “Simony and celibacy”, according to him, are stressed by Peter Damien as the principal vices to be eliminated . In addition to rounding off Braswell’s claim about the Lateran Council with earlier events such as the start of religious persecution at the Council of Reims in 1048 against sodomy, he also denies that these capitals are “sermons in stone” for the illiterate, claiming instead that they target exclusively the brethren . The scope of this reform is suggested by Baumann, who, by citing examples of demonic punishment in remote communities, suggests that Cluniac intervention might have had a greater demand than previously thought. She also gives a more direct reason why the imagery of avarice grew in number. Noting the emergence of a profit economy and, as a reaction to it, St. Alexis’ call for monastic societies to recourse to “purposeful poverty,” Baumann argues that these capitals reflect a “crisis of conscience” on the abbey’s part about their accumulation of wealth and are intended for a wider audience including pilgrims and merchants.

All the more conveniently, within the monastic community there is a constant need to purge one’s own sin even without systemic reforms. The revival of eschatology at the millennium, the redefinition of vice amidst the rise of asceticism , and the influence of Platonic thought conceived by 12th century cosmologists, which links physical deformity to spiritual corruption , all favor the formation of a new sensitivity toward punitive images. The cloister, in turn, provides the perfect setting for purgatory acts. A crucial crossing point between sacred (e.g. church) and mundane (e.g. refractory) space, the cloister is what Thomas Dale calls a “microcosm .” Serving as “hooks” for memory, the capitals aid the monks in their rumination of psalms and prayer, thereby posing as a daily moral reminder . This practice is particularly important in the 12th century, when monastic obsession with Phantasmata and the somatization of dreams compels monks see their fantasies as a mirror of their own body. This implies that one can exorcise his inner demons via creative work, a point made by Ernst Gombrich . A quite different approach is taken by Kirk Ambrose, who looks at the effectiveness of punitive images from a scientific standpoint. Referring to studies of mirror neurons, Ambrose concludes that people experience a more poignant compassio when seeing others undergo torture . Perhaps the most innovative argument is presented by Christa Sütterlin, who, in comparing medieval images of evil forces with apotropaic amulets in other cultures, contends that these motifs represent the “ ‘new’ religion’s” agnostic threat to all of human’s suffering . While it is hard to prove the apotropaic properties of the characters on PMA’s capital, it is likely that the medieval monk’s way of fending off his inner demons stems from the same biological roots as agnostic behaviors.

III.

Using the information above, we can now perceive the PMA capital as not only a culmination of iconographic traditions but also the result of a myriad of social factors. For example, the punishment of avarice on this capital attests to the universality of Peter Damien’s concern about sodomy by exhibiting remarkable ties with Peter’s writing: “You are made the prey of demons…All your enemies open their mouths against you; they hiss and gnash their teeth. They say: We have devoured her . The common features it shares with Auvergne and Conques is a clear indication of the spread of monastic reforms mentioned by both Baumann and McManamy. The effectiveness of its warning, on the other hand, is enhanced by its location in the cloister, its allusion to deformity of the soul by physical contortion, and its appeal to the agnostic instinct of human. In Ambrose’s case, the placid look of the damned at Conques arouses a fear for the loss of control over one’s body or paroxysm; in our case, the painful expression of the sinner, too, triggers a mirror response in the viewer. To see the perfect coordination between the institutions, theories, and representations of hamartiology confide in this one single architectural element is to witness a major shift in the medieval understanding of sin. Regardless of how it is manifested – in law, reform, theology, or art – the internalization of moral struggle is a common theme in 12th century France.

Eva Kimminich, writing about mass psychology of this time, is able to discern a growing interest in psychology of the individual. Although speaking of a latter time (14th and 15th century) and having at her disposal Giotto and Dante, her point about the “humanization of sins,” the inward movement of the battle between Vice and Virtue and the assimilation of demonic beings into human desires, has in fact seen its light three centuries ago, in the PMA capital. Transitioning from the naïve optimism of Psychomachia, where the battle is between the Devil and the Savior, to the increasingly ramified and personalized conception of sin in Late Medieval literature and theatre, where the battle is between the man and himself, the capital at PMA stands as a testimony to the a fundamental shift in the Christian doctrine of sin.
